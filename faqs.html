<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td width="600">
<strong>Product Features and Use</strong>
<br>
<img src=pix/leafbullet.gif> <a href="#suitability" class="Fsp.Reveal">Is the Applicator suitable for all users ?</a>
<div id="suitability"><table><tr><td width=25></td><td>
There are significant features in the design of the applicator which make it suitable for a very wide range of users.<ul type="square">
<li>	Handling and flexibility characteristics make it equally suitable for both left and right handed usage.
<li>	The deliberate overall lightness means that you do not have to be a large person to use the applicator with complete comfort.
<li>	Worker-height (and container-height) are simply accommodated using different lengths of delivery tube (which may also be trimmed to suit).
<li>	The storage tube handle is adjustable to any user's preference.
</ul>
</td></tr></table></div><br>

<img src=pix/leafbullet.gif> <a href="#powder" class="Fsp.Reveal">Can I use fine powders in the Applicator ?</a>
<div id="powder"><table><tr><td width=25></td><td>
Yes, the GreenElf Applicator 301 Series is designed specifically for free-flowing dry granular materials averaging in the range up to 1mm - such as Herbicides like Scotts Rout and Bayers Ronstar and many others. This can include other materials so long as they are free flowing and dry.<br>
For larger granules we recommend the 501 Series Applicator.
</td></tr></table></div><br>

<img src=pix/leafbullet.gif> <a href="#potting" class="Fsp.Reveal">Can the Hand-Held Applicator be used on a Potting Machine ?</a>
<div id="potting"><table><tr><td width=25></td><td>
Both the 501 and 301 Series GreenElf Applicators are availale in  Hand-Held (HH) and Automated Industrial (AI) models. The AI model is designed for the potting machine, conveyor belt, moving vehicle and other automated systems. There are a different set of accessories available designed for mounting the Applicator on Potting Machines and facility for remote triggering synchronized with pot position (eg. infra-red beam sensor).
</td></tr></table></div><br>

<img src=pix/leafbullet.gif> <a href="#aor" class="Fsp.Reveal">Does the GreenElf Applicator really have Automatic Obstruction Recovery ?</a>
<div id="aor"><table><tr><td width=25></td><td>
The are several Patent-Pending features in the applicator used to achieve both detection of an obstruction and the action needed to clear it. Typically, an obstruction is in the form of a clumped piece of poor-quality material. Such material is almost always cleared automatically and the action may not even be noticed by the operator. The Applicator will retry the clearance of an obstruction many times and only give up in the worst of cases. In the very unlikely event that the applicator cannot clear an obstruction, it will inform the user on the display panel. The User Guide contains simple instructions on how to clear an obstruction manually.
</td></tr></table></div><br>



<img src=pix/leafbullet.gif> <a href="#prill" class="Fsp.Reveal">How can the GreenElf Applicator Do no damage to the Prill Coatings ?</a>
<div id="prill"><table><tr><td width=25></td><td>
Experience and extensive testing shows that the GreenElf Applicator has nil or very little effect on the integrity of the coatings of Controlled Release Fertilizers (CRF). This is an important feature because you want to be sure that the material you use will retain its controlled release characteristics as intended by the manufacturer. The technique used to achieve the non-crushing and non-scraping of granules as they pass through the applicator in normal use is subject to Patent Pending status in the U.S.A.. We refer to this technology as Dynamic Bridging.
</td></tr></table></div><br>


<img src=pix/leafbullet.gif> <a href="#shotscharge" class="Fsp.Reveal">How many Shots can I get from a single Battery charge ?</a>
<div id="shotscharge"><table><tr><td width=25></td><td>
The GreenElf Applicator battery usage and charging system is designed to exceed the number of shots ever likely to be made in one day of operation. During testing in the workshop with a new battery, we have run over 45,000 shots on a single charge before the unit reports (on the display) that a recharge is required. Whatever your own daily usage, we recommend that during regular use you always fully charge overnight, every night, even if your own shot rate is under 20,000 per day.
 </td></tr></table></div><br>



<img src=pix/leafbullet.gif> <a href="#battery" class="Fsp.Reveal">How many years of service can I expect to get from the Battery ?</a>
<div id="battery"><table><tr><td width=25></td><td>
GreenElf Works uses only the latest top-quality 'Eneloop' branded Sanyo Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries.  If all battery charging procedures are followed, you can expect over 1,000 full charge/use/recharge cycles.   This is the equivalent of continuous use 7 days a week, every week, for close on three years.
